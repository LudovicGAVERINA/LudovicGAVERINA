### 👋 Hi, I'm Ludovic Gavérina

Senior Research Scientist at **ONERA**, working at the intersection of **physics, AI, and advanced sensing technologies**.

I develop **physics-driven models enhanced with AI** to push the boundaries of thermal analysis, multiphysics simulation, and structural evaluation.

My background spans optics, computer vision, and heat transfer:  
I trained as an engineer at **Telecom Saint-Étienne**, earned a Master's in **Optics, Image, and Computer Vision** from Jean Monnet University (2013), and completed a PhD in **Heat Transfer** at Bordeaux University (2017), focusing on the thermal characterization of heterogeneous materials using flying-spot laser excitation and infrared thermography.

🔬 **Research & Tech Focus**  
- Multiphysics & inverse modeling  
- AI-assisted simulation and predictive models  
- Automated & intelligent NDT workflows  
- Multimodal inspection techniques  
- Thermal imaging, laser excitation, material characterization  

🚀 **Mindset**  
Bridging **academic rigor** with a **startup-oriented vision**: rapid prototyping, reproducible pipelines, automation-first approach, and scalable AI/physics hybrid models.

📫 **Connect**  
Open to collaborations, discussions, and innovative ideas.
